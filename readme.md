# 🚀 Python Adventure: From Zero to Hero

Welcome to the Python Adventure: From Zero to Hero! 🏆 <br> 
This repository is designed for curious minds who want to level up their Python skills <br> 

# 📌 Projects in This Adventure

## (1) py-from-zero-to-hero-01 
### 🖥️ What is it? 
A console-based CRUD application built with Python and SQLite, that contains concepts of: 
- Connecting Python to SQLite 🗄️ 
- Performing Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations ✍️ 
- Running an interactive command-line interface 🏗️ 

## (2) py-from-zero-to-hero-02 
### 🌍 What is it? 
A Flask-based web API with best practices for: 
- Handling CRUD operations for user management 🛠️ 
- Managing configurations with .env and separate dev/prod settings 🔧 
- Running a Dockerized Flask API for scalable deployment 🐳 
- Using SQLAlchemy for database interactions 📊 

## (3) py-from-zero-to-hero-03
### 🤖 What is it?
Building upon everything we accomplished in the previous project, we are now expanding our API with new features as we embark on our journey into the world of LLMs. The enhancements include:

- Utilizing an LLM to determine the topic the user is inquiring about.
- Once the topic is identified, the application attempts to find an answer by scanning the contents of a folder.
- If the topic is not found within the folder's content, the application queries the database to retrieve information related to the user's purchase.
- Lastly, if the user initiates a topic that is not covered by the API, the application returns an appropriate error response.

## (4) py-from-zero-to-hero-04
### 🗨️🤖 What is it?
In this final module, we will introduce this fantastic library. 
Instead of manually sending JSON requests to our API, 
we'll leverage a chat assistant to help us to extract the backend information we need more efficiently.
